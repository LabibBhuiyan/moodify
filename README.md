# Moodify

Music Recommendation based on Mood and Emojis:
- Utilized Spotify API to retrieve user playlists and songs.
- Used Spotify's Audio Features API to extract mood-related features like tempo, energy, and valence from songs.

- Build a user interface that displays the analyzed moods and provides song recommendations based on the user's current mood.
