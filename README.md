# Moodify

Music Recommendation based on Mood and Emojis:
- Utilized Spotify API to retrieve user playlists and songs.
- Used Spotify's Audio Features API to extract mood-related features like tempo, energy, and valence from songs.
- Implemented a mood classification algorithm to categorize songs into different mood categories (e.g., happy, sad, energetic, relaxing).
- Created a user interface that displays the analyzed moods and provides song recommendations based on the user's current mood.

Tech Used:
- Spotify API
- React.js
- React Bootstrap
- CSS

Future of the Project:
- Get music recommendation based on any type of emoji.
- Utilize an image processing API or machine learning library (such as TensorFlow, OpenCV) to detect facial expressions/emotions in images.
- Develop an algorithm that can accurately recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc and relate it to a emoji mood.
- Based on the emoji mood, create a music recommendation.
